    <string name="user_como_jogarporpontos_t">How to play with points?</string>
    <string name="user_como_jogarporpontos_d">"A dominoes game of dots is played with board players, and are formed doubles. At a table, the two players face each other, can not tell which stones they have and start the game with the 6-sena. In the course of the game, if the player picks up an exit pass, it is worth 4 points, a two-way pass is worth 6 points, a normal pass is worth 2, a two-way pass is 4, a general one is worth 6, a general unconscious is worth 6 to another team, valley 4, chipped hit 8, and a 10-point chase hit, when the game is over and no team makes 20 points, a new match is started and the player is now close to the player who was a player in the previous match. The double game comes into play when the game is closed and there is no way to continue then a double game is started and each pass, general or hit is worth double points. "</string>
    <string name="user_passe_t">Pass</string>
    <string name="narrar_empate">The game is a draw!</string>
    <string name="user_passe_d">The pass is used when a player places a stone and the next player does not have the same as if the player has no place to play it passes, and 2 points are inserted to the players who gave the pass, for example: Players B passed the 2 points goes to Players A.</string>
    <string name="user_passe2_t">Pass 2</string>
    <string name="user_passe2_d">The pass of 2 is used when two players are passed even if the player of yours has passed the points are to those who gave the pass, worth 4 points.</string>
    <string name="user_passesaida_t">Outgoing and outgoing pass of 2</string>
    <string name="user_passesaida_d">It is the same scheme of the pass and pass of 2 only that when starting the game and is worth more than one pass and an exit pass</string>
    <string name="user_geral_t">General</string>
    <string name="user_geral_d">The general is used when a single player can play both a pass in all at once, more if the player of the pass of 3 (general) and does not shout \"General\" the general becomes unconscious taking the 6 points to the opposing team, you always have to check the stones before you play.</string>
    <string name="user_geralI_t">General unconscious</string>
    <string name="user_geralI_d">The general unconscious is how much one of the players in a general and forgets to shout \"General\", if this happens is because that move was not wanted and became unconscious taking the 6 points to the other team.</string>
    <string name="user_batidas_t">Beat, chip and beat</string>
    <string name="user_batidas_d">When a player has a stone, he will be able to finish the game if it is finished in a single point. The beat is normal and is worth 4 points if the player who hit has a stone that can hit the two points. and in the right of sena and the player owns a farm of sena, the beat will be chipped and is worth 8 points, more if the player hits with a cambur√£o the beat is worth 20 points.</string>
    <string name="user_20do_t">20 point match or folded</string>
    <string name="user_20dos_d">The 20-point match is used for team-time matches, every 20 points the match ends and a new team starts with another team. The doubled match happens when the game is closed without being able to open so it is restarted, and each point is worth twice as much.</string>
